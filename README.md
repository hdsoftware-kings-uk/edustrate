### Open-Source code on GitHub

The files contained in this GitHub repository have been created, shared and uploaded by HD Software LTD, based in the UK. We reserve the right to refuse any pull requests or revoke a downloaded release.

This program has been designed and built by:

* Theo Fletcher

You are permitted, under our Terms of Use, to use this code to develop applications that can work with Edustrate or addons for our marketplace (coming soon), but **you are not permitted, under any circumstance, to download this program and use it for your business, whether educational or not, without purchasing an official license from us.**

We do not at this time have a domain, but are in the process of purchasing one for the purposes of allowing you to be able to purchase a license, but you can contact us at **hdsoftwarehants@gmail.com** in the meantime.

### Versions Released
The most recent alpha version of Edustrate that has been released is v1.1.3-alpha, which adds in the Teacher UI feature to the program. Edustrate is expected to be officially released by v2.0, due by December 2021.

### Contributions
This code is, of course, open source, however there are some purposes we do not wish Edustrate to be used for, such as those listed above in Paragraph 3. We welcome contributions and ideas from third-party contributors and internal contributors, but HODs or Development need to approve the pull request before it can be merged with the `master` branch. (You will need to create a new branch when you commit something. It might ask you whether it wants you to commit directly to `master`: do not! Create a new one, and call it something like `username-patch-1`. It will be deleted if it is approved, so please don't expect it to last forever!).
