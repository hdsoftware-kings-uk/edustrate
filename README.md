# This repository is being retired
We have taken the decision to, as we are making entire overhauls and rebuilding Edustrate from the ground up, create a new repository. The new repo is **hdsoftware-uk/project-chalkboard**. When we create releases, the versions will start from v0.3.0 despite this changing the semantic system previously used.

This repository will not be deleted. It will be archived and read-only, but will still be forkable. You can also download the template from https://startbootstrap.com (it is called SB Admin 2).
